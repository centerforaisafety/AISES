<h1 class="unnumbered" id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedding itself within
militaries, economies, and societies, reshaping their very foundations.
Given the depth and breadth of its consequences, it has never been more
pressing to understand how to ensure that AI systems are safe, ethical,
and have a positive societal impact.<p>
This textbook aims to provide a comprehensive approach to understanding
AI risk. Our primary goals include consolidating fragmented knowledge on
AI risk, increasing the precision of core ideas and reducing barriers to
entry by making content simpler and more comprehensible. The book has
been designed to be accessible to undergraduates from diverse academic
backgrounds. You do not need to have studied AI, philosophy, or other
such topics. The content is skimmable and somewhat modular, so that you
can choose which chapters to read. We introduce formulas in a few places
to specify claims more precisely, but readers with less mathematical
knowledge should be able to understand the arguments without
these.<p>
A full understanding of the risks posed by AI requires knowledge in
several disparate academic disciplines, which have so far not been
combined in a single text. This book was written to fill that gap. This
textbook moves beyond the confines of machine learning to provide a
holistic understanding of AI risk. We draw on well-established ideas and
frameworks from the fields of engineering, economics, biology, physics,
philosophy and other disciplines that can provide insights into AI risks
and how to manage them. Our aim is to equip readers with a solid
understanding of the technical, ethical, and governance challenges that
we will need to meet in order to harness advanced AI in a beneficial
way.<p>
In order to have a solid grasp of the challenges of AI safety, it is
important to consider the broader context within which AI systems are
being developed and applied. The decisions of and interplay between AI
developers, policy-makers, militaries and other actors will play an
important role in shaping this context. Since AI influences many
different spheres, we have deliberately selected time-tested, formal
frameworks to provide multiple lenses for thinking about AI and its
impacts. The frameworks and concepts we use are highly general and are
useful for reasoning about various forms of intelligence, ranging from
individual human beings to corporations, states, and AI systems. While
some sections of the book focus more directly on AI risks that have
already been identified and discussed today, others set out a systematic
introduction to ideas from game theory, utility theory, complex systems,
ethics, and more. We hope that providing these flexible conceptual tools
helps readers to adapt robustly to the ever-changing landscape of AI
risks.<p>
This book does not aim to be the final word on all possible AI risks, as
research on AI risk is still relatively new. Rather, we aim to highlight
the dynamics and frameworks that we have found highly productive for
thinking about various AI risks. Given the broad scope of the problems
involved, it is easy to become disoriented. Our hope is that this
textbook provides some scaffolding for others to use as they build out a
more detailed picture of these risks and the potential responses to
them.<p>
The textbook’s content falls into four sections: Background, Safety, Ethics, and
Society. In the Background section, we outline major categories of AI risks and introduce some key features of modern AI systems.
In the Safety section, we discuss how to make individual AI systems
more safe. However, if we can make them safe, how should we direct them?
To answer this, we turn to the Ethics section and discuss how to make AI
systems promote human values. Finally, in the Society section, we turn
to the numerous challenges that emerge when there are multiple AI
systems or multiple AI developers with competing interests.<p>

The Background section starts with an informal overview of AI risks, 
which summarises many of the key concerns discussed in this book. We
outline some scenarios where AI systems could cause catastrophic
outcomes. We split risks across four categories: malicious use, AI arms
race dynamics, organizational risks, and rogue AIs. These categories can
be loosely mapped onto the risks discussed in more depth in Governance, Collective Action Problems, Safety Engineering, and Single-Agent Safety
chapters, respectively. However, this mapping is imperfect as many of
the risks and frameworks discussed in the textbook are more general and
cut across scenarios. Nonetheless, we hope that these scenarios give
readers a more concrete picture of the risks that we explore in this
book. The AI Fundamentals chapter gives an accessible and non-mathematical explanation of current AI
systems, setting out concepts in machine learning, deep learning, scaling laws, and so on. 
This provides the necessary foundations for the discussion of
the safety of individual AI systems in the next section.<p>

The Safety section aims to provide an overview of core challenges in safely
building advanced AI systems. It draws on key insights from both machine
learning research and from general theories of safety engineering and
complex systems which provide a powerful lens on these issues. In Single-Agent Safety,
we explore challenges in making individual AI systems safer, such as
bias, transparency, and emergence. In Safety Engineering, we discuss principles for creating safer organizations 
and how these may apply to those developing and deploying AI. The need for
a robust safety culture at organizations developing AI is crucial, so
organizations do not prioritize profit at the expense of safety. In our
discussion of safety engineering, we rely on complex systems-based
models and methods, as they are dominant in safety science research.
Next, in , we show that analyzing AIs as complex systems helps us to
better understand the difficulty of predicting how they will respond to
external pressures or controlling the goals that may emerge in such
systems. More generally, this chapter provides us with a useful
vocabulary for discussing various systems.<p>
The Ethics section focusses on how to instill objectives and constraints in AI
systems in order to avert severe risks and ensure positive outcomes. In
the Machine Ethics chapter, we introduce the challenge of giving AI systems objectives that will
reliably lead to beneficial outcomes for society, and discuss various
proposals along with the challenges they face. The Ethics chapter dives deeper into the question of how to ensure
that AI systems behave in ways that reflect our values and how to reconcile conflicting views on these values. We think we
should not try to reinvent systematic thinking about values from scratch and should instead draw
from existing ethical systems, so the chapter aims to give readers a
background in major theories and concepts in normative ethics. The appendix on Utility Functions is 
connected to the theme of objectives and constraints in AI systems, as it reviews formal methods to model 
self-interested AI agents and challenges we might face in adjusting their
goals if these turn out to be faulty. <p>
The final section on has two chapters: and . In , we utilize game theory
to illustrate the many ways in which multiple agents (humans, AIs,
groups of humans and AIs) can fail to secure good outcomes and come into
conflict. We also consider the evolutionary dynamics shaping AI development
and how these drive AI risks. These frameworks help us
to understand the challenges of managing competitive pressures between
AI developers, militaries, or AI systems themselves. Finally, in the
chapter, we discuss strategic variables such as the rate at which AI
evolves and how widely it is distributed. We introduce a variety of
potential paths for managing AI risks, including corporate governance,
national regulation, and international coordination.<p>
