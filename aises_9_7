<h1 id="sec:int-gov"> 9.7 International Governance</h1>
<p>In this section, we will discuss the international governance of AI
systems. First, we will consider the problem of the international
governance of AI. Then, we will discuss the basics of international
governance, such as its stages and techniques. To determine what sort of
international cooperation is possible and necessary, we will discuss
four key questions that are important for understanding features of the
emerging technologies we wish to regulate. Lastly, we will discuss
possibilities for the international governance of AIs, separately
considering AIs made by civilians and AIs made by militaries.</p>
<p><strong>International regulation can promote global benefits and
manage shared risks.</strong> It is important to actively regulate AI
internationally. Firstly, it allows for the distribution of global
benefits that advanced AIs can provide, such as improved healthcare,
increased efficiency in transportation, and enhanced communication.
Countries can work together to ensure that AI technologies are developed
and deployed in a way that benefits humanity as a whole.<br />
Secondly, international governance of AI is necessary to manage
effectively the risks associated with its development. The risks from AI
systems are not confined to the country in which they are developed; for
instance, even if an AI system is developed in the US, it is likely to
be deployed around the world, and so its impacts will be felt worldwide.
Risks, such as the danger of progressively weaker national regulations
in the absence of international standards and the potential for arms
races in which actors cut corners on safety in order to compete, require
international cooperation to avoid <span class="citation"
data-cites="armstrong2016racing"></span>. From the point of view of
public safety, the risks of negative effects of systems developed across
borders is a simple and powerful argument for international
governance.</p>
<p><strong>International governance of powerful technologies is
challenging.</strong> In general, international cooperation takes place
through bilateral or multilateral negotiations between relevant
countries, or through international organizations like the UN and its
agencies. Even at the best of times and with the least contentious of
issues, international cooperation is slow, difficult, and often
ineffectual. Strained international relationships, such as frequent
tensions between the US and China, make successful international
standards even less likely.<br />
For the regulation of AI, we can draw analogies to the regulation of
other dangerous technologies such as nuclear, biological, and chemical
weapons. While these analogies are imperfect, they give us reasons to be
concerned about the prospects of international cooperation for AI. There
are few convincing examples of agreements between major powers to limit
the development of technologies for which there were no military
substitutes. However, we can learn from both the failures and successes
of past regulation: by asking questions about how AI is similar to past
technologies, we can understand what form successful and unsuccessful
governance might take.</p>
<h2 id="forms-of-international-governance"> 9.7.1 Forms of International
Governance</h2>
<p>Before we can consider how to govern AIs internationally, we must
understand the nature of international governance. We will first
consider the different stages of international governance, from
recognizing a problem exists to ensuring that its governance is
effective. Then, we will consider a range of techniques used by
international actors to ensure global governance.</p>
<h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>
<p>We can break international governance into four stages <span
class="citation" data-cites="avant2010governs"></span>. First, issues
must be recognized as requiring governance. Then, countries must come
together to agree how to govern the issue. After that, they must
actually do what was agreed. Lastly, countries’ actions must be
monitored for compliance to ensure that governance is effective into the
future.</p>
<p><strong>Setting agendas.</strong> The first stage of governance is
agenda-setting. This involves getting an issue recognized as a problem
needing collective action. Actors have to convince others that an issue
exists and matters. Powerful entities often want to maintain their power
in the status quo, and thus deny problems or ignore their
responsibilities for dealing with them. Global governance over an issue
can’t start until it gets placed on the international agenda. Non-state
actors like scientists and advocacy groups play a key role in
agenda-setting by drawing attention to issues neglected by states; for
example, scientists highlighted the emerging threat of ozone depletion,
building pressure that led to the Montreal Protocol.<br />
Agenda-setting makes an issue a priority for collective governance.
Without it, critical problems can be overlooked due to political
interests or inertia.</p>
<p><strong>Policymaking.</strong> Once an issue makes the global agenda,
collections of negotiating countries or international organizations
often take the lead in policymaking. Organizations like the UN
facilitate formal negotiations between states to develop policies, as
seen at major summits on climate change. In other cases, organizations’
own procedures shape policies over time; for instance, export control
lists in the US like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations are
expanded by regulators without Congressional action. Organizations
manage competing country interests to build consensus on vague or
detailed policies. For example, the International Civil Aviation
Organization brought countries together to agree on aircraft safety
standards. Effective policymaking by organizations converts identified
issues into guidelines for collective action. Without actors taking
responsibility for driving the policy process, implementation lacks
direction.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation and enforcement.</strong> After policies are
made, the next stage is implementing them. High-level policies are
sometimes vague, allowing flexibility to apply them; for example, the
Chemical Weapons Convention relies on countries to enforce bans on
chemical weapons domestically in the ways they find most effective.
Governance controls how these policies are enforced; for instance, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducts inspections to verify
compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT). Even if actors agree on policies, acting on them takes resources,
information, and coordination. Effective implementation and enforcement
through governance converts abstract rules into concrete actions.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation, monitoring, and adjudication.</strong> The final
stage of governance is evaluating outcomes and monitoring compliance.
The organization implementing policies may perform these oversight tasks
itself. But often other actors play watchdog roles as third-party
evaluators. It may be formally established who assesses compliance, like
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). In
other cases, evaluation is informal, with self-appointed civil society
monitors. Both insiders and outsiders frequently evaluate progress
jointly. For example, the UN, OPCW, and NGOs all track progress on
chemical weapons disarmament. Clarifying who monitors and evaluates
policies is important to ensure accountability and transparency. Without
effective evaluation, it is difficult to learn from and improve on
governance efforts over time.</p>
<h3 id="techniques">Techniques</h3>
<p>There are many ways in which countries and other international actors
govern issues of global importance. Here, we consider six ways that past
international governance of potentially dangerous technologies has taken
place, ranging from individual actors making unilateral declarations to
wide-ranging, internationally binding treaties.</p>
<p><strong>Unilateral commitments.</strong> Unilateral commitments
involve single actors like countries or companies making pledges
regarding their own technology development and use. For example,
President Richard Nixon terminated the US biological weapons program and
dismissed its scientists in 1969, which was instrumental in creating the
far-reaching Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. Leaders within
governments and companies can make such announcements, either about what
they would do in response to others’ actions or to place constraints on
their own behavior. While not binding on others, unilateral commitments
can change others’ best responses to a situation, as well as build
confidence and set precedents to influence international norms. They
also give credibility in pushing for broader agreements. Unilateral
commitments lay the groundwork for wider collective action.</p>
<p><strong>Norms and standards.</strong> International norms and
technical standards steer behavior without formal enforcement. Norms are
shared expectations of proper conduct, such as the norm of “no first
use” for detonating nuclear weapons. Standards set technical best
practices, like guidelines for the safe handling and storage of
explosives. Often, norms emerge through public discourse and precedent
while standards arise via expert communities. Even if they have no
ability to coerce actors, strong norms and standards shape actions
nonetheless. Additionally, they make it easier to build agreements by
aligning expectations. Norms and standards are a collaborative way to
guide technology development.</p>
<p><strong>Bilateral and multilateral talks.</strong> Two or more
countries directly negotiate over a variety of issues through bilateral
or multilateral talks. These allow open discussion and
confidence-building between rivals, such as granting the US and USSR the
ability to negotiate over the size and composition of their nuclear
arsenals during the Cold War. Talks aim to establish understandings to
avoid technology risks like arms races. Regular talks build
relationships and identify mutual interests. While non-binding
themselves, ongoing dialogue can lay the basis for making deals. Talks
are essential for compromise and consensus between nations.</p>
<p><strong>Summits and forums.</strong> Summits and forums bring
together diverse stakeholders for debate and announcements. These raise
visibility on issues and build political will for action. Major powers
can make joint statements signaling priorities, like setting goals on
total carbon emissions to limit the effects of global warming. Companies
and civil society organizations can announce major initiatives. Summits
set milestones for progress and mobilize public pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Governance organizations.</strong> International
organizations develop governance initiatives with diverse experts and
resources. Organizations like the IAEA propose principles and governance
models, such as an inspection and verification paradigm for nuclear
technology. They provide neutral forums to build agreements. Their
technical expertise also assists implementation and capacity-building.
While largely voluntary, organizations lend authority to governance
efforts, often by virtue of each of their members delegating some
authority to them. Their continuity sustains attention between summits.
Organizations enable cooperation for long-term governance.</p>
<p><strong>Treaties.</strong> Treaties offer the strongest form of
governance between nations, creating obligations backed by potential
punishment. Treaties have played a large role in banning certain risky
military uses of technologies, such as the 1968 Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. They often contain enforcement
mechanisms like inspections. However, compromising on enforceable rules
is difficult, especially between rivals. Verifying compliance with
treaties can be challenging. Still, the binding power of treaties makes
them valuable despite their potential limitations.<br />
In this section, we have considered the various stages of international
governance, moving from recognizing an issue to solving it, as well as a
wide variety of different ways that enable this. This is a large set of
tools, so we will next examine four questions that inform our
understanding of which tools are most effective for AI governance.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="four-questions-for-ai-regulation"> 9.7.2 Four Questions for AI
Regulation</h2>
<p>We will now consider four questions that are important for the
regulation of dangerous emerging technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is the technology defense-dominant or offense-dominant?</p></li>
<li><p>Can compliance with international agreements be
verified?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it catastrophic for international agreements to fail?</p></li>
<li><p>Can the production of the technology be controlled?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these highlights important strategic variables that we are
uncertain about. They give us insights into the characteristics of the
technology we are dealing with. Consequently, they help us illustrate
what sorts of international cooperation may be possible and
necessary.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-technology-defense-dominant-or-offense-dominant">Is the
Technology Defense-Dominant or Offense-Dominant?</h3>
<p><strong>AI capabilities determine the need for international
governance.</strong> Suppose we could use some AIs to prevent other AIs
from doing bad things. There would be less need for an international
regime to govern AIs. Instead, AI development would prevent the harms of
AI development—such technology is called <em>defense-dominant</em>. By
contrast, if AI is an offense-dominant technology—–if AIs cannot manage
other AIs as the technological frontier advances–—then we will need
alternative solutions <span class="citation"
data-cites="garfinkel2021does"></span>. Unfortunately, we have reason to
believe that AIs will be offense-dominant: military technologies usually
are. It is difficult for AIs to protect against threats from other AIs;
an AI that can make the creation of engineered pandemics easy is much
more likely to exist than one that can comprehensively defend against
pandemics. It is usually easier to cause harm than prevent it.<br />
Nuclear weapons are a classic example of offense-dominant technologies:
when asked how to detect a nuclear weapon smuggled into New York in a
crate, Robert Oppenheimer replied “with a screwdriver” to open every
crate <span class="citation" data-cites="panofsky2008panofsky"></span>.
In other words, there was no feasible technological solution; a social
solution was required. When dealing with offense-dominant technologies,
we often need to develop external social measures to defend against
them. Similarly, if AIs prove to be offense-dominant, they will also
require social solutions to protect against their potential harmful
impacts. Since the scale of the technology is global, this will likely
require international governance.</p>
<h3 id="can-compliance-with-international-agreements-be-verified">Can
compliance with international agreements be verified?</h3>
<p>Verification of compliance means agreements can regulate technology.
After establishing rules about the development and use of AIs, we need
to verify whether signatories are following them. If it is easy to
evaluate this, then it is easier to implement such regimes
internationally. In the case of nuclear weapons, nuclear tests could be
verified by monitoring for large explosions. Using a nuclear weapon is
impossible to do discreetly, enabling the norm of no first use.
Unfortunately, verifying how and when AIs are being developed and used
may be difficult to verify–—certainly more so than observing a nuclear
explosion.<br />
Verification is a difficult technical challenge. We lack clear methods
for conducting verification, since we do not know what to test to ensure
that models are safe. Progress can be made with serious effort; for
instance, investing in the development of standard benchmarks and
evaluations that promote transparency and enable shared knowledge that
other developers are using responsible development practices (such as
mitigating any power-seeking tendencies in AI systems). This will allow
the creation of clear standards that can be verified with relative ease,
without compromising the confidentiality of privileged technical
details. However, this requires investment: we must make progress on our
ability to verify characteristics of AIs before we can implement
effective international regulation. Until then, establishing an
equilibrium to deter the dangerous use of AIs may not be possible.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-catastrophic-for-international-agreements-to-fail">Is It
Catastrophic for International Agreements to Fail?</h3>
<p><strong>Whether agreements failing is catastrophic changes how
permissive they can be.</strong> Consider an example of an international
treaty that sets limits on the amount of compute that organizations can
use to train their AIs. If an AI trained with more compute than the
specified threshold poses a significant risk of catastrophic
consequences—–just as even a single nuclear weapon can have devastating
effects–—then the treaty must focus on preventing this possibility
entirely. In such cases, deviations from the agreement cannot be
permitted. On the other hand, if most AIs trained with more compute than
the threshold amount pose little immediate danger, we can adopt a more
lenient approach. In this scenario, the agreement can prioritize
monitoring and disincentivizing deviations through punishments after the
fact. In general, if even one actor deviating from an agreement is
dangerous, then it must be much stricter.<br />
Of course, stricter agreements are more difficult to create. Many
international agreements present small punishments for deviation or
include escape clauses—–allowing occasional exemptions from
obligations—–to encourage states to sign the agreements. If agreements
about the development and use of AIs cannot contain such clauses, then
it will be more difficult to create widespread agreement on them.</p>
<h3 id="can-the-production-of-the-technology-be-controlled">Can the
Production of the Technology Be Controlled?</h3>
<p><strong>Controlling production changes which actors are needed in
order to succeed with international regulation.</strong> Suppose the US
could gain complete control of all the compute required to produce AIs.
Then, the US would be able to create and implement regulations on AI
development that apply globally, since they can withhold compute from
any non-compliant actors. More generally, if a small group of
safety-conscious countries can block actors from gaining control of the
factors of production, then they can create an international regime
themselves. This makes it much easier to achieve international
governance since it doesn’t require the cooperation of many foreign
actors with distinct interests.</p>
<p>By answering these questions, we can make important decisions about
international governance. First, we understand whether we need
international governance or whether AIs will be able to mitigate the
harmful effects of other AIs. Second, we determine whether international
agreements are possible, since we need to verify whether actors are
following the rules. Third, we can decide what features these agreements
might have; specifically, we can determine whether they must be
extremely restrictive to avoid catastrophes from a single deviation.
Lastly, we consider who must agree to govern AI by understanding whether
or not a few countries can impose regulations on the world. Even if some
of these answers imply that we live in high-risk worlds, they guide us
towards actions that help mitigate this risk. We can now consider what
these actions might be.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-be-included-in-international-agreements"> 9.7.3 What Can Be
Included in International Agreements?</h2>
<p>We will now consider the specific tools that might be useful for
international governance of AI. We separate this discussion into
regulating AIs produced by the private sector and AIs produced by
militaries, since these have different features and thus require
different controls. For civilian AIs, certification of compliance with
international standards is the key precedent to follow. For military
AIs, we can turn to non-proliferation agreements, verification schemes,
or the establishment of AI monopolies.</p>
<p><strong>Regulating the private sector is important and
tractable.</strong> Much of the development of advanced AIs is seemingly
taking place in the private sector. As a result, ensuring that private
actors do not develop or misuse harmful technologies is a priority.
Regulating civilian development and use is also likely to be more
feasible than regulating militaries, although this might be hindered by
overlaps between private and military applications of AIs (such as
civilian defense contracts) and countries’ reluctance to allow an
international organization access to their firms’ activities.</p>
<p><strong>Certification has proven to be an effective tool.</strong>
One proposal for civilian governance involves certifying jurisdictions
for having and enforcing appropriate regulation <span class="citation"
data-cites="trager2023international"></span>. Some international
organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization
(ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF), follow a similar approach. These organizations
leave enforcement in the hands of domestic regulators, but they check
that domestic regulators have appropriate procedures. States have
incentives to comply with the international organizations’ standards
because of the ecosystems in which they are embedded. The Federal
Aviation Administration, for instance, can deny access to US airspace to
states that violate ICAO standards. In the case of AI, states might deny
access to markets and factors of production to the firms of
jurisdictions that violate international standards.</p>
<p>Governing military AIs is different from governing civilian ones.
Most of the options for governing AI used by militaries can be described
as drawing from one of three regimes: <em>nonproliferation plus norms of
use</em>, <em>verification</em>, or <em>monopoly</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Nonproliferation plus Norms of Use.</strong> The
<em>nonproliferation</em> regime, alongside norms against first use of
nuclear weapons–—along with a measure of luck—–enabled the world to
survive the Cold War. This regime was centered around the
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), an international agreement primarily
concerned with stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an international organization
for the governing of nuclear energy. In addition, nonproliferation was a
pillar of super-power foreign policy during the Cold War <span
class="citation" data-cites="gavin2015strategies"></span>. Both the US
and USSR made many threats and promises, including guarantees of
assistance to third parties, to reduce the likelihood of nuclear weapons
being used anywhere. A similar international regime for AI could be
similarly helpful; for instance, it could enable countries to cooperate
to avoid AI races and encourage the development of safer AI by
establishing standards and guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Nonproliferation may be insufficient.</strong> Suppose
investing in AI continues to reliably increase system
capabilities—–unlike with nuclear weapons, where the security gain from
additional weapons of mass destruction is low. Then, countries who
already have advanced AI will have strong incentives to continue to
compete with each other. As we have explored, increasing AI capabilities
is likely to increase AI risk. This means that nonproliferation plus
norms of use might be insufficient for controlling advanced, weaponized
AIs.</p>
<p><strong>Norms may be difficult to establish.</strong> With nuclear
weapons, the <em>norms</em> of “no first use” and “mutually assured
destruction” created an equilibrium that limited the use of nuclear
weapons. With AIs, this might be more difficult for a variety of
reasons: for instance, AIs have a much broader field of capabilities (as
opposed to a nuclear weapon detonating) and AIs are already being widely
used. Monitoring or restricting the development or use of new AI systems
requires deciding precisely which capabilities are prohibited. If we
cannot decide which capabilities are the most dangerous, it is difficult
to decide on a set of norms, which means we cannot rely on norms to
encourage the development of safe AIs.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Verification.</strong> Many actors might be happy
to limit their own development of military technology if they can be
certain their adversaries are doing the same. <em>Verification</em> of
this fact can enable countries to govern each other, thereby avoiding
arms races. The Chemical Weapons Convention, for instance, has
provisions for verifying member states’ compliance, including
inspections of declared sites.<br />
When it comes to critical military technologies, however, verification
regimes might need to be invasive; for instance, it might be necessary
to have the authority to inspect <em>any</em> site in a country. It is
unclear how they could function in the face of resistance from domestic
authorities. For these reasons, a system which relies on inspection and
similar police—like methods might be entirely infeasible—unless all
relevant actors agree to mutually verify and govern.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3: Monopoly.</strong> The final option is a
<em>monopoly</em> over the largest-scale computing processes, which
removes the incentive for risk-taking by removing adversarial
competition. Such monopolies might arise in several ways. Established AI
firms may benefit from market forces like economies of scale, such as
being able to attract the best talent and invest profits from previous
ventures into new R&amp;D. Additionally, they might have first-mover
advantages from retaining customers or exercising influence over
regulation. Alternatively, several actors might agree to create a
monopoly: there are proposals like “CERN for AI” which call for this
explicitly <span class="citation"
data-cites="coyle2023preempting"></span>. Such organizations must be
focused on the right mission, perhaps using tools from corporate
governance, which is a non-trivial task. If they are, however, then they
present a much easier route to safe AI than verification and
international norms and agreements.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-about-international-governance">Conclusions About
International Governance</h3>
<p><strong>International governance is important and difficult.</strong>
International regulation of AI is crucial to distribute its global
benefits and manage associated risks. Since AI’s impacts are not
restricted to its country of development, an internationally coordinated
approach ensures that advantages, like improved healthcare, are
accessible worldwide, and risks, such as weak regulations or safety
shortcuts, are avoided. This approach will need to create awareness that
a problem exists, create policies that tackle it, oversee the
implementation of these policies, and ensure compliance with them
through verification. It can use a wide variety of tools, including
unilateral declarations, talks through meetings, forums, and
international organizations, and the creation of norms, standards, and
binding treaties. From experience with other dangerous technologies, we
know that this global cooperation is challenging to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding features of AI is required for effective
governance.</strong> We need to understand whether AI is an
offense-dominant technology which poses significant risks if even one
powerful system is imperfect. This tells us whether we need
international cooperation of AIs and, if we do, what sort of enforcement
features such agreements would require to be effective. Further, we need
to know whether we can verify whether AI development meets a
comprehensive list of regulations and standards and control its
production when it does not. If this is possible, we can conclude that
international regulation of AI is possible, and might be possible with
the cooperation of just a small group of safety-conscious countries.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the landscape, we can govern civilian and
military AIs.</strong> Civilian AIs largely originate from the private
sector, making certification of compliance with international standards
vital. Existing organizations, like the International Civilian Aviation
Organization, effectively use certification; states could restrict
market access to firms that violate international AI standards. For
military AIs, options include nonproliferation agreements plus
established norms, verification of technology development between
nations, or creating monopolies on large-scale computing. If the risks
of advanced AI are as great as some fear, it is likely that the world
needs such regulation. Each proposal will require overcoming serious
challenges, both social and technical.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion"> 9.8 Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the introduction, we laid out the purpose of this chapter:
understanding the fundamentals of how to govern AI. In other words, we
wanted to understand how to organize, manage, and steer the development
and deployment of AI technologies using an array of tools including
norms, policies, and institutions. To set the scene, we considered a set
of actors and tools that governance needs to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Takeoff.</strong> We explored potential scenarios for
advanced AI takeoff. There is serious uncertainty regarding when these
transformative AIs will arise and whether progress will follow
continuous trends or exhibit abrupt, discontinuous jumps in
capabilities. However, once they emerge, advanced AIs are likely to
massively accelerate technological advancement and economic growth. This
acceleration could profoundly reshape human civilization, potentially
within a short timeframe. Careful governance, informed by answers to
questions about how AI development will progress, will be essential for
steering it in broadly positive directions that benefit humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong> We then explored three key dimensions
around which the impacts of advanced AI systems may be distributed:
power among AIs, access to AIs, and costs/benefits of AIs. First, in
terms of distributing power among AIs, concentrating capabilities and
control in a single AI or small group of AIs poses risks like
permanently locking in certain values or goals. However, distributing
power more widely among a large, diverse ecosystem of AIs also has
downsides, like increasing the potential for misuse or making it more
difficult to correct AI systems that begin behaving undesirably.<br />
Second, regarding access to AIs, it is unclear whether availability
should be tightly restricted or widely open to the general public.
Limiting access risks misuse by powerful groups whereas open access
risks misuse by malicious actors. Third, equitable distribution of the
economic and social impacts of AI will be crucial, including dealing
with potential technologically-induced unemployment while ensuring that
productivity gains are shared broadly rather than accruing only to a
small group like AI developers and investors. Distributing these three
key aspects of advanced AI fairly will require thoughtful
governance.</p>
<p><strong>Compute Governance.</strong> Next, we explored how governing
access to and use of the computing resources that enable AI development
could provide an important lever for influencing the trajectory of AI
progress. Compute is an indispensable input to developing advanced AI
capabilities. It also has properties like physicality, excludability,
and quantifiability that make governing it more feasible than other
inputs like data and algorithms. Compute governance can allow control
over who is granted access to what levels of computational capabilities,
controlling who can create advanced AIs. It also facilitates setting and
enforcing safety standards for how compute can be used, enabling the
steering of AI development.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Governance.</strong> At the organizational level,
we discussed how aspects of corporate structure and governance like
legal form, ownership models, policies, practices, and assurance
mechanisms can help steer technology companies away from solely
maximizing profits and shareholder value. Instead, they can guide
corporate AI work in directions that prioritize broader societal
interests like safety, fairness, privacy, and ethics. However, achieving
this through corporate governance alone may prove challenging, making
complementary approaches at other levels vital.</p>
<p><strong>National Governance.</strong> For governance at the national
level, we explored policy tools governments can use to align AI
development with public interests, both in the public and private
sectors. These included safety regulations, liability rules that make AI
developers internalize potential damages, investments to improve
societal resilience against AI risks, and measures for maintaining
national competitiveness in AI while still ensuring domestic safety.
Combinations of these policy mechanisms can help nations steer AI
progress in their jurisdictions towards beneficial ends.</p>
<p><strong>International Governance.</strong> At the international
level, governance of AI systems is made challenging by issues like
verifying adherence to agreements. However, international cooperation is
essential for managing risks from AI and distributing benefits globally.
Approaches like international safety standards for civilian AI
applications, agreements to limit military uses of AI, and proposals for
concentrating advanced AI development within select transnational
groups, may all help promote global flourishing. A lack of any
meaningful international governance could lead to a dangerous spiral of
competitive dynamics and erosion of safety standards.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> This chapter provides an overview of a
diverse selection of governance solutions spanning from policies within
technology firms to agreements between nations in global institutions.
The arrival of transformative AI systems will require thoughtful
governance at multiple levels in order to steer uncertain technological
trajectories in broadly beneficial directions aligned with humanity’s
overarching interests. The deliberate implementation of policies,
incentives and oversight will be essential to realizing the potential of
AI to improve human civilization rather than destroy it.</p>
