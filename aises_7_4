<h1 id="conflict">7.4 Conflict</h1>
<h2 id="overview">7.4.1 Overview</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have been exploring the risks generated or exacerbated by the interactions of multiple agents, both human and AI. In the previous section, we explored a variety of 
mechanisms by which agents can achieve stable cooperation. In this section we address how, despite the fact that cooperation can be so beneficial to all involved, a group of agents may 
instead enter a state of conflict.</p>
<p> Here, we use the term ``conflict'' loosely, to describe the decision to defect rather than cooperate in a competitive situation. 
This often, though not always, involves some form of violence, and destroys some amount of value. Conflict is common in nature. Organisms engage in conflict to maintain social dominance 
hierarchies, to hunt, and to defend territory. Throughout human history, wars have been common, often occurring as a consequence of power-seeking behavior, which
inspired conflict over attempts at aggressive territorial expansion or resource acquisition. Another lens on relations between power-seeking states and other entities is provided by the theory 
of <i>structural realism</i> discussed in the chapter Single Agent Safety. Our goal is to uncover how, despite being costly, conflict can sometimes be a rational choice 
nevertheless.</p>
<p>Conflict can take place between a wide variety of entities, from microorganisms to nation-states. It can be sparked by many different factors, such as resource competition and territorial 
disputes. Despite this variability, there are some general frameworks which we can use to analyse conflict across many different situations. In this section, we look at how some of these 
frameworks might be used to model conflict involving AI agents. </p>
<p>We begin our discussion of conflict with concepts in bargaining
theory. We then examine some specific features of competitive situations
that make it harder to reach negotiated agreements or avoid
confrontation. We begin with five factors from bargaining theory that
can influence the potential for conflict. These can be divided into the
following two groups: <p> <strong>Commitment problems.</strong> According to
bargaining theory, one reason bargains may fail is that some of the
agents making an agreement may have the ability and incentive to break
it. We explore three examples of commitment problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Power shifts</em>: when there are imbalances between agents’
capabilities such that one agent becomes stronger than the other,
conflict is more likely to emerge between them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>First-strike advantages</em>: when one agent possesses the
element of surprise, the ability to choose where conflict takes place,
or the ability to quickly defeat their opponent, the probability of
conflict increases.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Issue indivisibility</em>: agents cannot always divide a good
however they please – some goods are “all or nothing” and this increases
the probability of conflict between agents.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information problems.</strong> According to bargaining
theory, the other principal cause of a bargaining failure is that some
of the agents may lack good information. Uncertainty regarding a rival’s
capabilities and intentions can increase the probability of conflict. We
explore two information problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Misinformation</em>: in the real world, agents frequently
have incorrect information, which can cause them to miscalculate
suitable bargaining ranges.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Disinformation</em>: agents may sometimes have incentives to
misrepresent the truth intentionally. Even the expectation of
disinformation can make it more difficult to reach a negotiated
settlement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Factors outside of bargaining theory.</strong> Bargaining frameworks do not encompass all possible reasons why agents may decide to conflict with one another. These approaches to analyzing conflict are <em>rationalist</em>, assuming that both parties are rationally considering whether and how to engage in conflict. However, non-rationalist approaches to conflict (taking into account factors such as identity, status, or relative deprivation) may turn out to be more applicable to analyzing conflicts involving some AIs; for example, AIs trained on decisions made by human agents may focus on the social acceptability of actions rather than their consequences. We end by exploring one example of a factor standing outside of rationalist approaches that can help to predict and explain conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Inequality</em>: under conditions of inequality, agents may
fight for access to a larger share of available resources or a desired
social standing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conflict can be rational.</strong> Though humans know
conflict can be enormously costly, we often still pursue or instigate
it, even when compromise might be the better option.<p>
Consider the following example: a customer trips in a store and sues the
owner for negligence. There is a 60% probability the lawsuit is
successful. If they win, the owner has to pay them $40,000, and going to
court will cost each of them $10,000 in legal fees. There are three
options: (1) they or the owner concede, (2) they both let the matter go
to court, (3) they both reach an out-of-court settlement.<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the owner concedes, the owner loses $40,000, and if the
customer concedes, they gain nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>If both go to court, the owner’s expected payoff is the product
of the payment to the customer and the probability that the lawsuit is
successful minus legal fees. In this case, the owner’s expected payoff
would be <span class="math inline">(−40,000×0.6) − 10, 000</span> while
the customer’s expected payoff would be <span
class="math inline">(40,000×0.6) − 10, 000</span>. As a result, the
owner loses $34,000 dollars and the customer gains $14,000
dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>An out-of-court settlement x where <span
class="math inline">14, 000 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 34, 000</span> would
enable the customer to get a higher payoff and the owner to pay lower
costs. Therefore, a mutual settlement is the best option for both if
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is in this range.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hence, if the proposed out-of-court settlement would be greater than
$34,000, it would make sense for the owner to opt for conflict rather
than bargaining. Similarly, if the proposed settlement were less than
$14,000, it would be rational for the customer to opt for conflict.</p>

<p><strong>AIs and large-scale conflicts.</strong> Several of the examples we consider in this section are large-scale conflicts such as interstate war. If the use of AI were to increase the likelihood or severity of such conflicts, it could have a devastating effect. AIs have the potential to accelerate our wartime capabilities, from augmenting intelligence gathering and weaponizing information such as deep fakes to dramatically improving the capabilities of lethal autonomous weapons and cyberattacks. If these use-cases and other capabilities become prevalent and powerful, AI will change the nature of conflict. If armies are eventually composed of mainly automated weapons rather than humans, the barrier to violence might be much lower for politicians who will face reduced public backlash against lives lost, making conflicts between states (with automated armies) more commonplace. Such changes to the nature and severity of war are important possibilities with significant ramifications. In this section, we focus on analyzing the decision to enter a conflict, continuing to focus on how rational, intelligent agents acting in their own self-interest can collectively produce outcomes that none of them wants. To do this, we ground our discussion of conflict in bargaining theory, highlighting some ways in which AI might increase the odds that states or other entities decide to start a conflict.</p>

<h2 id="bargaining-theory">7.4.2 Bargaining Theory</h2>
<p>Here, we begin with a general overview of bargaining theory, to
illustrate how pressures to outcompete rivals or preserve power and
resources may make conflict an instrumentally rational choice. Next, we
turn to the unitary actor assumption, highlighting that when agents view
their rivals as unitary actors, they assume that they will act more
coherently, taking whatever steps necessary to maximize their welfare.
Following this, we discuss the notion of commitment problems, which
occur when agents cannot reliably commit to an agreement or have
incentives to break it. Commitment problems increase the probability of
conflict, and are motivated by specific factors, such as power shifts,
first-strike advantages, and issue indivisibility. We then explore how
information problems and inequality can also increase the probability of
conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Bargaining theory.</strong> When agents compete for something
they both value, they may either negotiate to reach an agreement
peacefully, or resort to more forceful alternatives such as violence. We
call the latter outcome “conflict,” and can view this as the decision to
defect rather than cooperate. Unlike peaceful bargaining, conflict is
fundamentally costly for winners and losers alike. However, it may
sometimes be the rational choice. <em>Bargaining theory</em> describes
why rational agents may be unable to reach a peaceful agreement, and
instead end up engaging in violent conflict. Due to pressures to
outcompete rivals or preserve their power and resources, agents
sometimes prefer conflict, especially when they cannot reliably predict
the outcomes of conflict scenarios. When rational agents assume that
potential rivals have the same mindset, the probability of conflict
increases.</p>
<p><strong>The unitary actor assumption.</strong> We tend to assume that
a group is a single entity, and that its leader is only interested in
maximizing the overall welfare of the entity. We call this the
<em>unitary actor assumption</em>, which is another name for the “unity
of purpose” assumption discussed previously in this chapter. A nation in
disarray without coherent leadership is not necessarily a unitary actor.
When we view groups and individuals as unitary actors, we can assume
they will act more coherently, so they can be more easily modeled as
taking steps necessary to maximize their welfare. When parties make this
assumption, they may be less likely to cooperate with others since what
is good for one party’s welfare may not necessarily be good for
another’s.</p>
<p><strong>The bargaining range.</strong> Whether or not agents are
likely to reach a peaceful agreement through negotiation will be
influenced by whether their bargaining ranges overlap. The bargaining
range represents the set of possible outcomes that both agents involved
in a competition find acceptable through negotiation. Recall the lawsuit
example: a bargaining settlement “<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>” is only acceptable if it falls
between $14,000 and $34,000. Any settlement “<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>” below $14,000 will be rejected by
the customer while any settlement “<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>” above $34,000 will be rejected by
the store owner. Thus, the bargaining range is often depicted as a
spectrum with the lowest acceptable outcome for one party at one end and
the highest acceptable outcome for the other party at the opposite end.
Within this range, there is room for negotiation and potential
agreements.</p>

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 7.9: A) An axis of expected value distribution between two competitors. “B” indicates the expected outcome of conflict: how likely each competitor is to win, multiplied by the value they gain by winning. The more positive B is (the further towards the right), the better for Green, and the worse for Red. B) Conflict is negative- sum: it destroys some value, and so reduces each competitor’s expected value. C) Bargaining is zero-sum: all the value is distributed between the competitors. This means there are possible bargains that offer both competitors greater expected value than conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Conflict in AIs.</strong> Let us assume that AI agents will
act rationally in the pursuit of their goals (so, at the least, we model
them as unitary actors or as having unity of purpose). In the process of
pursuing and fulfilling their goals, AI agents may encounter potential
conflict scenarios, just as humans do. In certain scenarios, AIs may be
motivated to pursue violent conflict over a peaceful resolution, for the
reasons we now explore.</p>
<h2 id="commitment problems">7.4.3 Commitment Problems</h2>
<p>Many conflicts occur over resources, which are key to an agent’s
power. Consider a bargaining failure in which two agents bargain over
resources in an effort to avoid war. If agents were to acquire these
resources, they could invest them into military power. As a result,
neither can credibly commit to use them only for peaceful purposes. This
is one instance of a <em>commitment problem</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="fearon1995rationalist">[3]</span>, which is when agents
cannot reliably commit to an agreement, or when they may even have
incentives to break an agreement. Commitment problems are usually
motivated by specific factors, such as power shifts, first-strike
advantages, and issue indivisibility, which may make conflict a rational
choice. It is important to note that our discussion of these commitment
problems assumes anarchy: we take for granted that contracts are not
enforceable in the absence of a higher governing authority.</p>
<p><strong>Power shifts overview.</strong> When there are imbalances
between parties’ capabilities such that one party becomes stronger than
the other, <em>power shifts</em> can occur. Such imbalances can arise as
a consequence of several factors including technological and economic
advancements, increases in military capabilities, as well as changes in
governance, political ideology, and demographics. In the context of AIs,
power could shift if AIs become more intelligent or have a change in
resources. Individual parties may initially be able to avoid violent
conflict by arriving at a peaceful and mutually beneficial settlement
with their rivals. However, if they or their rival’s power increases
after this settlement has been made, the stronger party may end up
benefiting from it more than the weaker party. Thus, we encounter the
following commitment problem: the rising power cannot commit not to
exploit their advantage in the future, incentivizing the declining power
to opt for conflict in the present.</p>
<p><strong>Example: The US vs China.</strong> China has been investing
heavily in its military. This has included the acquisition or expansion
of its capabilities in technologies such as nuclear and supersonic
missiles, as well as drones. The future is uncertain, but if this trend
continues, it could increase the risk of conflict. If China were to gain
a military advantage over the US, this could shift the balance of power.
This possibility undermines the stability of bargains struck today
between the US and China, because China’s expected outcome from conflict
may increase in the future if they become more powerful. The US may
expect that agreements made with China about cooperating on AI
regulation could lose enforceability later if there is a significant
power shift.<p>
This situation can be modeled using the concept of “Thucydides’ Trap.”
The ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested that the contemporary
conflict between Sparta and Athens might have been the result of Athens’
increasing military strength, and Sparta’s fear of the looming power
shift. Though this analysis of the Peloponnesian War is now
much-contested, this concept can nevertheless serve to understand how a
rising power threatening the position of an existing superpower in the
global order can increase the potential for conflict rather than
peaceful bargaining.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on the bargaining range.</strong> Consider two agents,
A and B. A is always weaker than B, but relative to the time period, A
is weaker in the future than it is in the present. A will always have a
lower bargaining range, so B will be unlikely to accept any settlements,
especially as B’s power increases. It makes sense for A to prefer
conflict, because if it waits, B’s bargaining range will shift further
and further away, eliminating any overlap between the two. Therefore, A
prefers to gamble on conflict even if the probability that A wins is
lower than B; the costs of war do not outweigh the benefits of a
peaceful but unreasonable settlement. Consider the 1956 Suez Crisis.
Egypt was seen as a rising power in the Middle East, having secured
control over the Suez Canal. This threatened the interests of the
British and French governments in the region, who responded by
instigating war. To safeguard their diminishing influence, the British
and French launched a swift and initially successful military
intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Power shifts and AI.</strong> AIs could shift power as they
acquire greater capabilities and gain more access to resources. Recall the Single-Agent Safety
chapter, where we saw that an agent’s power is highly related to the
efficiency with which they can exploit resources for their benefit,
which often depends on their level of intelligence. The power of future
AI systems is largely unpredictable; we do not know how intelligent or
useful they will be. This could give rise to substantial uncertainty
regarding how powerful potential adversaries using AI might become. If
this is the case, there might be reason to engage in conflict to prevent
the possibility of adversaries further increasing their power.</p>
<p><strong>First-strike advantage overview.</strong> If an agent has a
<em>first-strike advantage</em>, they will do better to launch an attack
than respond to one. This gives rise to the following commitment
problem: an offensive advantage may be short-lived, so it is best to act
on it before the enemy does instead. Some ways in which an agent may
have a first-strike advantage include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As explored above, anticipating a future power shift may motivate
an attack on the rising power to prevent it from gaining the upper
hand.</p></li>
<li><p>The costs of conflict might be lower for the attacker than they
are for the defender, so the attacker is better off securing an
offensive advantage while the defender is still in a position of
relative weakness.</p></li>
<li><p>The odds of victory may be higher for whichever agent attacks
first. The attacker might possess the element of surprise, the ability
to choose where conflict takes place, or the potential to quickly defeat
their opponent. For instance, a pre-emptive nuclear strike could be used
to target an enemy’s nuclear arsenal, thus diminishing their ability to
retaliate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Examples: IPOs, patent Infringement, and Pearl
Harbor.</strong> When a company goes public, it can release an IPO,
allowing members of the general public to purchase company shares.
However, company insiders, such as executives and early investors, often
have access to valuable information not available to the general public;
this gives insiders a first-strike advantage. Insiders may buy or sell
shares based on this privileged information, leading to potential
regulatory conflicts or disputes with other investors who do not have
access to the same information. Alternatively, when a company develops a
new technology and files a patent application, they gain a first-strike
advantage by ensuring that their product will not be copied or
reproduced by other companies. If a rival company does create a similar
technology and later files a patent application, conflict can emerge
when the original company claims patent infringement.<p>
On the international level, we note similar dynamics, such as in the
case of Pearl Harbor. Though Japan and the US were not at war in 1941,
their peacetime was destabilized by a commitment problem: if one nation
were to attack the other, they would have an advantage in the ensuing
conflict. The US Pacific fleet posed a threat to Japan’s military plans
in Southeast Asia. Japan had the ability to launch a surprise long-range
strategic attack. Thus, neither the US nor Japan could credibly commit
not to attack the other. In the end, Japan struck first, bombing the US
battleships at the naval base at Pearl Harbor. The attack was successful
in securing a first-strike advantage for Japan, but it also ensured the
US’s entry into WWII.<p>

<br>

<p><strong>Effect on the bargaining range.</strong> When the advantages
of striking first outweigh the costs of conflict, it can shrink or
destroy the bargaining range entirely. For any two parties to reach a
mutual settlement through bargaining, each must be willing to freely
communicate information with the other. However, in doing so, each party
might have to reveal offensive advantages, which would increase their
vulnerability to attack. The incentive to preserve and therefore conceal
an offensive advantage from opponents’ pressures agents to defect from
bargaining.</p>
<p><strong>First-strike advantage and AIs.</strong> One scenario in
which an AI may be motivated to secure a first-strike advantage is
cyberwarfare. An AI might hack servers for a variety of reasons to
secure an offensive advantage. AIs may want to disrupt and degrade an
adversary’s capabilities by attacking and destroying critical
infrastructure. Alternatively, an AI might gather sensitive information
regarding a rival’s capabilities, vulnerabilities, and strategic plans
to leverage potential offensive advantages.<p>
AIs may provide first-strike advantages in other ways, too. Sudden and
dramatic progress in AI capabilities could motivate one party to take
offensive action. For example, if a nation very rapidly develops a much
more powerful AI system than its military enemies, this could present a
powerful first-strike advantage: by attacking immediately, they may hope
to prevent their rivals from catching up with them, which would lose
them their advantage. Similar incentives were likely at work when the US
was considering a nuclear strike on the USSR to prevent them from
developing nuclear weapons themselves <span class="citation"
data-cites="condit1996joint">[4]</span>.<p>
Reducing the possibility of first-strike advantages is challenging,
especially with AI. However, we can lower the probability that they
arise by ensuring that there is a balance between the offensive and
defensive capabilities of potential rivals. In other words, defense
dominance can facilitate peace because attempted attacks between rivals
are likely to be unsuccessful or result in mutually assured destruction.
Therefore, we might reduce the probability that AIs are motivated to
pursue a first-strike advantage by ensuring that humans maintain defense
dominance, for instance, by requiring that advanced AIs have a built-in
incorruptible fail-safe mechanism, such as a manual “off-switch.”</p>

bargaining offers to worsen in the future.</p>
<!--<figcaption>First strike advantage</figcaption>-->
</figure>

<p><strong>Issue indivisibility overview.</strong> Settlements that fall
within bargaining range will always be preferable to conflict, but this
assumes that whatever issues agents bargain over are divisible. For
instance, two agents can divide a territory in an infinite amount of
ways insofar as the settlement they arrive at falls within the
bargaining range, satisfying both their interests and outweighing the
individual benefits of engaging in conflict. However, some goods are
indivisible, which inspires the following commitment problem <span
class="citation" data-cites="powell2006war">[5]</span>: parties cannot
always divide a good however they please—some goods are “all or
nothing.” When parties encounter <em>issue indivisibility</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="fearon1995rationalist">[3]</span>, the
probability of conflict increases. Indivisible issues include
monarchies, small territories like islands or holy sites, national
religion or pride, and sovereign entities such as states or human
beings, among several others.</p>
<p><strong>Examples: shopping, organ donation, and
co-parenting.</strong> Imagine two friends that go out for a day of
shopping. For lunch, they stop at their favorite deli and find that it
only has one sandwich left: they decide to share this sandwich between
themselves. After lunch, they go to a clothing store, and both come
across a jacket they love, but of which there is only one left. They
begin arguing over who should get the jacket. Simply put, sandwiches can
be shared and jackets can’t. Issue indivisibility can give rise to
conflict, often leaving all parties involved worse off.<p>
The same can be true in more extreme cases, such as organ donation.
Typically, the available organ supply does not meet the transplant needs
of all patients. Decisions as to who gets priority for transplantation
may favor certain groups or individuals and allocation systems may be
unfair, giving rise to conflict between doctors, patients, and
healthcare administrations. Finally, we can also observe issue
indivisibility in co-parenting contexts. Divorced parents sometimes
fight for full custody rights over their children. This can result in
lengthy and costly legal battles that are detrimental to the family as a
whole.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on the bargaining range.</strong> When agents
encounter issue indivisibilities, they cannot arrive at a reasonable
settlement through bargaining. Sometimes, however, issue indivisibility
can be resolved through side payments. One case in which side payments
were effective was during the Spanish-American War of 1898, fought
between Spain and the United States over the territory of the
Philippines. The conflict was resolved when the United States offered to
buy the Philippines from Spain for 20 million dollars. Conversely, the
Munich Agreement at the dawn of WWII represents a major case where side
payments were ineffective. In an attempt to appease Hitler and avoid
war, the British and French governments reached an agreement with
Germany, allowing them to annex certain parts of Czechoslovakia. This
agreement involved side payments in the form of territorial concessions
to Germany, but it ultimately failed, as Hitler’s aggressive
expansionist ambitions were not satisfied, leading to the outbreak of
World War II. Side payments can only resolve issue indivisibility when
the value of the side payments outweighs the value of the good.<p>
<strong>Issue indivisibility and AIs.</strong> Imagine that there is a very
powerful AI training system, and that whoever has access to this system
will eventually be able to dominate the world. In order to reduce the
chance of being dominated, individual parties may compete with one
another to secure access to this system. If parties were to split the
AI’s compute up between themselves, it would no longer be as powerful as
it was previously, perhaps not more powerful than their existing
training systems. Since such an AI cannot be divided up among many
stakeholders easily, it may be rational for parties to conflict over
access to it, since doing so ensures global domination.</p>
<h2 id="information-problems">7.4.4 Information Problems</h2>
<p>Misinformation and disinformation both involve the spread of false
information, but they differ in terms of intention. Misinformation is
the dissemination of false information, without the intention to
deceive, due to a lack of knowledge or understanding. Disinformation, on
the other hand, is the deliberate spreading of false or misleading
information with the intent to deceive or manipulate others. Both of
these types of information problem can cause bargains to fail,
generating conflict.</p>

<p>The term <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is the
probability of a player knowing the strategy of its partner. Relevant
for AI since it might reduce uncertainty (though still chaos and

<p><strong>Misinformation overview.</strong> Uncertainty regarding a
rival’s power or intentions can increase the probability of
conflict<span class="citation"
data-cites="fearon1995rationalist">[3]</span>. Bargaining often requires
placing trust in another not to break an agreement. This harder to
achieve when one agent believes something false about the other’s
preferences, resources, or commitments. This lack of shared, accurate
information can lead to mistrust and a breakdown in negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Russian invasion of Ukraine.</strong> Incomplete
information may lead overly optimistic parties to make too large
demands, whereas rivals that are tougher than expected reject those
demands and instigate conflict. Examples of misinformation problems
generating conflict may include Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Russian President Putin reportedly miscalculated Ukraine’s willingness
to resist invasion and fight back. With more accurate information
regarding Ukraine’s abilities and determination, Putin may have been
less likely to instigate conflict <span class="citation"
data-cites="jenkins2022will">[6]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on the bargaining range.</strong> Misinformation can
prevent agents from finding a mutually-agreeable bargaining range, as
shown in Figure 7.11. For example, if each agent believes themself to be
the more powerful party, each may therefore want more than half the
value they are competing for. Thus, each may reject any bargain offer
the other makes, since they expect a better if they opt for conflict
instead.</p>

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 7.11: Green either believes themself to be - or intentionally
misrepresents themself as - more powerful than they really are. This
means that the range of bargain offers Green will choose over conflict
does not overlap with the equivalent range for Red. Thus, there is no
mutual bargaining range.</p>

<p><strong>Misinformation and AI.</strong> AI technologies may produce
misinformation directly. Examples of this include large language models
hallucinating false facts. Less directly, AI development could also
exacerbate misinformation problems by increasing uncertainty. For
example, military AI applications may make wars more uncertain, and this
may increase the probability of conflict. AI weaponry innovation
presents an opportunity for states to gain power. However, AI
capabilities advances are often highly uncertain—it may be unclear how
powerful a model trained on an order of magnitude of compute would be,
or how far behind adversaries are in their effort to create powerful
models. As automated warfare technologies become more widespread and
sophisticated, nations may struggle to predict their probability of
victory in any given conflict accurately. This increased potential for
miscalculation may make warfare more likely.<p>
Information problems could exacerbate other AI risks. For example, if there are substantial existential risks from AIs but this is not widely agreed on, improving understanding 
of these risks could help make different actors (such as the US and China) get better estimates of the payoff matrix. With better understanding of AI risk, they may recognize that
 it is in their self-interest to cooperate (slow down AI development and militarization) instead of defecting (engaging in an AI race). Similarly, creating information channels such
 as summits can increase understanding and coordination; even if countries do not agree on shared commitments, the discussions on the sidelines can reduce misunderstandings and the 
risk of conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Disinformation overview.</strong> Unlike misinformation,
where false information is propagated without deceptive intention,
disinformation is the <em>deliberate</em> spreading of false
information: the intent is to mislead, deceive or manipulate. Here, we
explore why competitive situations may motivate agents to try to mislead
others or misrepresent the truth, and how this can increase the
probability of conflict.<p>
<strong>Examples: employment and the real estate industry.</strong>
Throughout labor markets, employers and job seekers often encounter
disinformation problems. Employers may intentionally withhold
information about the salary range or offer lower wages than what the
market standard suggests in order to secure lower employment costs. On
the other hand, job seekers might exaggerate their qualifications or
professional experience to increase their chances of getting hired. Such
discrepancies can lead to legal conflicts and high turnover rates.
Alternatively, in the real estate market, disinformation problems can
emerge between sellers and buyers. Sellers sometimes withhold critical
information about the property’s condition to increase the probability
that the property gets purchased. Buyers, on the other hand, may be
incentivized to misrepresent their budget or willingness to pay to
pressure sellers to lower their prices. Oftentimes, this can result in
legal battles or disputes as well as the breakdown of property
transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on the bargaining range.</strong> Consider two agents:
A, which is stronger, and B, which is weaker. B demands “X” amount for a
bargaining settlement, but A, as the stronger agent, will not offer this
to avoid being exploited by B. In other words, A thinks B is just trying
to get more for themself to “bait” A or “bluff” by implying that the
bargaining range is lower. But B might not be bluffing and A might not
be as strong as they think they are. Consider the Sino-Indian war in
this respect. At the time, India had perceived military superiority
relative to China. But in 1962, the Chinese launched an attack on the
Himalayan border with India, which demonstrated China’s superior
military capabilities, and triggered the Sino-Indian war. Thus, stronger
parties may prefer conflict if they believe rivals are bluffing.
Whereas, weaker parties may prefer conflict if they believe rivals are
not as powerful as they believe themselves to be.<p>
<strong>Disinformation and AI.</strong> AIs themselves may have
incentives to misrepresent the facts. For example, the agent “Cicero,”
developed by Meta <span class="citation"
data-cites="meta2022human">[7]</span>, is capable of very high
performance in the board wargame “Diplomacy.” Its success requires it to
misrepresent certain information to the other players in a strategic
fashion. We have seen many other examples of AIs producing
disinformation for a variety of reasons, such as large language models
successfully persuading users that they are conversing with a human. The
ability of AIs to misrepresent information successfully is only likely
to increase in future <span class="citation"
data-cites="chen2021always">[8]</span>. This could exacerbate
disinformation problems, and thus contribute to greater risk of conflict
by eroding the potential for peaceful negotiation <span class="citation"
data-cites="Burtell2023ArtificialIA">[9]</span>.</p>
<h3 id="factors-outside-of-bargaining-theory">Factors Outside of
Bargaining Theory</h3>
<p><strong>Inequality is another factor that is highly predictive of
conflict.</strong> Crime is a form of conflict. Income and educational
inequality are robust predictors of violent crime <span class="citation"
data-cites="kelly2000inequality">[10]</span>, with an elasticity in
excess of 0.5 (elasticity measures how sensitive one variable is to
changes in another variable) even when controlling for variables such as
race and family composition. Similarly, individuals and families with a
yearly income below $15,000 are three times more likely to be the
victims of violent crime than are individuals and families with a yearly
income over $75,000 <span class="citation"
data-cites="victimrates2011">[11]</span>. Moreover, economists from the
World Bank have also highlighted that the effects of inequality on both
violent and property crime are robust between countries, finding that
when economic growth improves in a country, violent crime rates decrease
substantially <span class="citation"
data-cites="fajnzylber2002inequality">[12]</span>. This is consistent
with evidence at the national level; in the US, for example, the Bureau
of Justice reports that households below the federal poverty level have
a rate of violent victimization that is more than twice as high as the
rate for households above the federal poverty level. Moreover, these
effects were largely consistent between both rural and urban areas where
poverty was prevalent, further emphasizing the robust relationship
between inequality and conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Inequality and relative deprivation.</strong> Relative
deprivation is the perception or experience of being deprived or
disadvantaged in comparison to others. It is a subjective measure of
social comparison, not an objective measure of deprivation based on
absolute standards. People may feel relatively deprived when they
perceive that others possess more resources, opportunities, or social
status than they do. This can lead to feelings of resentment. For
example, “Strain theory,” proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton,
suggests that individuals experience strain or pressure when they are
unable to achieve socially approved goals through legitimate means.
Relative deprivation is a form of strain, which may lead individuals to
resort to various coping mechanisms, one of which is criminal behavior.
For example, communities with a high prevalence of relative deprivation
can evolve a subculture of violence <span class="citation"
data-cites="horne2009effect">[13]</span>. Consider the emergence of
gangs, in which violence becomes a way to establish dominance, protect
territory, and retaliate against rival groups, providing an alternative
path for achieving a desired social standing.</p>
<p><strong>AIs and relative deprivation.</strong> Advanced future AIs
and widespread automation may propel humanity into an age of abundance,
where many forms of scarcity have been largely eliminated on the
national, and perhaps even global scale. Under these circumstances, some
might argue that conflict will no longer be an issue; people would have
all of their needs met, and the incentives to resort to aggression would
be greatly diminished. However, as previously discussed, relative
deprivation is a subjective measure of social comparison, and therefore,
it could persist even under conditions of abundance.<p>
Consider the notion of a “hedonic treadmill,” which notes that
regardless of what good or bad things happen to people, they
consistently return to their baseline level of happiness. For instance,
reuniting with a loved one or winning an important competition might
cultivate feelings of joy and excitement. However, as time passes, these
feelings dissipate, and individuals tend to return to the habitual
course of their lives. Even if individuals were to have access to
everything they could possibly need, the satisfaction they gain from
having their needs fulfilled is only temporary.<p>
Abundance becomes scarcity reliably. Dissatisfied individuals can be
favored by natural selection over highly content and comfortable
individuals. In many circumstances, natural selection could disfavor
individuals who stop caring about acquiring more resources and expanding
their influence; natural selection favors selfish behavior (for more
detail, see the section "Levels of Selection and Selfish Behaviour"
of <em>Evolutionary Pressures</em>). Even under conditions of abundance,
individuals may still compete for resources and influence because they
perceive the situation as a zero-sum game, where resources and power
must be divided among competitors. Individuals that acquire more power
and resources could incur a long-term fitness advantage over those that
are “satisfied” with what they already have. Consequently, even with
many resources, conflict over resources could persist in the evolving
population.<p>
Relatedly, in economics, the law of markets, also known as “Say’s Law,”
proposes that production of goods and services generates demand for
goods and services. In other words, supply creates its own demand.
However, if supply creates demand, the amount of resources required to
sustain supply to meet demand must also increase accordingly. Therefore,
steady increases in demand, even under resource-abundant conditions will
reliably result in resource scarcity.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict over social standing and relative power may
continue.</strong> There will always be scarcity of social status and
relative power, which people will continue to compete over. Social envy
is a fundamental part of life; it may persist because it tracks
differential fitness. Motivated by social envy, humans establish and
identify advantageous traits, such as the ability to network or climb
the social ladder. Scarcity of social status motivates individuals to
compete for social standing when doing so enables access to larger
shares of available resources. Although AIs may produce many forms of
abundance, there would still be dimensions on which to compete.
Moreover, AI development could itself exacerbate various forms of
inequality to extreme levels. We discuss this possibility in the Governance chapter in section 9.3 - Distribution.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Throughout this section, we have discussed some of the major factors
that drive conflict. When any one of these factors is present, agents’
incentives to bargain for a peaceful settlement may shift such that
conflict becomes an instrumentally rational choice. These factors
include power shifts, first-strike advantages, issue indivisibility,
information problems and incentives to misrepresent, as well as
inequality.<p>
In our discussion of these factors, we have laid the groundwork for
understanding the conditions under which decisions to instigate conflict
may be considered instrumentally rational. This knowledge base allows us
to better predict the risks and probability of AI-driven conflict
scenarios.<p>

Power shifts can incentivize AI agents to pursue
conflict, maintain strategic advantages or deter potential attacks
from stronger rivals, especially in the context of military AI
use.<p>
The short-lived nature of offensive advantages
may incentivize AIs to pursue first-strike advantages, to degrade or
identify vulnerabilities in adversaries’ capabilities, as may be the
case in cyberwarfare.<p>
In the future, individual parties may compete for access to a world-dominating
AI. We reasoned that since dividing this AI between many stakeholders
would reduce its power, parties may find it instrumentally rational to
conflict for access to it.<p>
AI may make wars more uncertain, increasing
the probability of conflict. We expect that AI weaponry innovation will
present an opportunity for superpowers to consolidate their dominance,
whereas weaker states may be able to quickly increase their power by
taking advantage of these technologies early on. This dynamic may create
a future in which power shifts are uncertain, which may lead states to
incorrectly expect that there is something to gain from going to
war.<p>
Even under conditions of abundance facilitated by
widespread automation and advanced AI implementation, relative
deprivation, and therefore conflict may persist. We also explored the
possibility that AIs may be motivated by social envy to compete with
other humans or AIs for desired social standing. This may result in a
global landscape in which the majority of humanity’s resources are
controlled by selfish, power-seeking AIs.<p>
