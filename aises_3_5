<h1 id="systemic-safety"> 3.5 Systemic safety</h1>
<p>AI can be used to help defend against the potential risks it poses. Three important examples of this approach are use of AI to improve defenses against cyber-attacks,
 to enhance security against pandemics, and to improve the information environment. This philosophy of leveraging AI’s capabilities for societal resilience has been called “systemic safety”
<span class="citation" data-cites="hendrycks2022unsolved">[1], while the broader idea of focussing on technologies that defend against societal risks is sometimes described as “defensive accelerationism”
<span class="citation" data-cites="Buterin2023">[2].
<p><strong>AI for cybersecurity.</strong> Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure are a growing concern. For example, a 2021 ransomware attack on the Colonial oil pipeline 
led to regional gasoline shortages in the Eastern US for several days <span class="citation" data-cites="gao2024critical">[3]. AI systems are already quite capable at
writing code, and may exacerbate the threat of cyber-attacks by reducing the barrier to entry to hacking and identifying ways to increase the potency, success rate, scale, 
speed, and stealth of attacks. There is some early evidence of AI system's abilities in this domain and reducing the cost and difficulty of cyber-attacks could give attackers
 a major advantage <span class="citation" data-cites="shao2024empirical">[4]. Since these attacks can undermine critical physical infrastructure such as power grids,
 they could prove highly destabilising and threaten international security.
  
<p>However, AI could also be used to find vulnerabilities in codebases, shoring up defenses against AI-enabled hacking. If applied appropriately, this could shift the 
offense-defense balance of cyber-attacks and reduce the risk of catastrophic attacks on public services and critical infrastructure <span class="citation" data-cites="hendrycks2022unsolved">[1].
For example, AI could be used to monitor systems and networks to detect unauthorized access or imposter threats. ML methods could analyze source code to find malicious payloads. 
ML models could monitor program behaviors to flag abnormal network traffic. Such systems could provide early attack warnings and contextual explanations of threats. 
Advances in code translation and generation also raise the possibility that future AI could not just identify bugs, but also automatically patch them by editing code to fix vulnerabilities.</p>   
<p><strong>AI for biosecurity.</strong> As discussed in section 1.2, the use of AI to facilitate the creation of bio-engineered pandemics is a significant concern. 
However, AI tools could also promote biosecurity by enabling real-time epidemic detection, improving disease forecasting, screening synthesis of gene sequences to prevent misuse, 
and accelerating medical countermeasure development <span class="citation" data-cites="aiforbiosecurity">[5]. AI systems could improve our ability to analyze diverse data
streams to identify disease outbreaks early and enable rapid response. AI might be applied in other ways to provide early warning of potential pandemics, for example via 
novel techniques for metagenomic sequencing of wastewater. Algorithms could also forecast future disease trends by parameterizing models and predicting new risks. 
To prevent misuses of synthetic biology, AI may help with screening gene synthesis orders to flag potentially dangerous sequences. It would be particularly valuable 
to improve available tools for identifying novel pathogens that might evade existing screening measures. AI has already started to be applied in drug discovery and 
may be able to significantly expedite vaccine and treatment development <span class="citation" data-cites="aifordrugs">[6].
<p><strong>AI to improve the information environment.</strong> AI could help society to be more resilient to misinformation by detecting false claims and providing 
evidence-backed answers to questions. For example, it could be used to provide automatic fact-checking or additional context for controversial claims and articles 
shared on social media <span class="citation" data-cites="aifakenews">[7]. AI-generated content raises concerns about more credible misinformation, with some initial
reports appearing about use of this content to manipulate election results
<span class="citation" data-cites="audiodeepfakes">[8]. Equally concerning is the prospect of eroded trust in content that is not in fact AI-generated, due to inability
 to distinguish the two, which could contribute to a more fragmented and polarised information environment. Development of tools to enable effective watermarking of 
AI-generated content could be a helpful first step towards building epistemic resilience.</p>
</p>Many important decisions rely on human forecasts of future events, but machine learning systems may be able to make more accurate predictions by aggregating larger 
volumes of unstructured information <span class="citation" data-cites="hendrycks2022unsolved">[1]. ML tools could analyze disparate data sources to forecast geopolitical,
epidemiological, and industrial developments over months or years. The accuracy of such systems could be evaluated by their ability to retroactively predict pivotal historical 
events. Additionally, ML systems could help identify key questions, risks, and mitigation strategies that human forecasters may overlook. By processing extensive data and 
learning from diverse situations, AI advisors could provide relevant prior scenarios and relevant statistics such as base rates. They could also identify stakeholders to consult, 
metrics to track, and potential trade-offs to consider. In this way, ML forecasting and advisory systems could enhance judgment and correct misperceptions, ultimately improving 
high-stakes decision making and reducing inadvertent escalation risks. However, safeguards would be needed to prevent overreliance and to avoid encouraging inappropriate risk-taking.</p>  
<p><strong>Systemic safety requires investments in physical infrastructure and equipment, not just digital solutions.</strong> It is worth noting that while AI can provide valuable 
defensive tools in these domains, it is not the only solution, and investment in other areas such as physical infrastructure and equipment could be even more valuable. 
For example, the potential risk from pandemics could be reduced through improvements to buildings’ air ventilation, filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lighting, 
which would make it more difficult for respiratory viruses to travel from one person to another. Similarly, investments in stockpiling personal protective equipment 
such as masks and gowns, and developing more effective and comfortable next-generation personal protective equipment, could prove valuable in countering the spread 
of future pandemics and ensuring that healthcare and other essential services can continue to operate. </p>
