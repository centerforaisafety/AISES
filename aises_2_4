<h1 id="sec:scaling-laws">2.4 Scaling Laws</h1>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Compelling evidence shows that increases in the performance of many
AI systems can be modeled with equations called <em>scaling laws</em>.
Common knowledge suggests that larger models with more data will perform
better, frequently reiterated in phrases like “add more layers” or “use
more data.” Scaling laws make this folk knowledge mathematically
precise. In this section, we show that the performance of a deep
learning model scales according to parameter count and dataset size—both
of which are primarily bottlenecked by the computational resources
available. Scaling laws describe the relationship between a model’s
performance and primary inputs.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-background-power-laws">Conceptual Background: Power
Laws </h3>
<p>Power laws are mathematical equations that model how a particular
quantity varies as the power of another. In power laws, the variation in
one quantity is proportional to a power (exponent) of the variation in
another. The power law <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>b</em><em>x</em><sup><em>a</em></sup></span>
states that the change in <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> is
directly proportional to the change in <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> raised to a certain power <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>. If <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is <span
class="math inline">2</span>, then when <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is doubled, <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> will quadruple. One real-world
example is the relation between the area of a circle and its radius. As
the radius changes, the area changes as a square of the radius: <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>π</em><em>r</em><sup>2</sup></span>.
This is a power-law equation where <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = <em>π</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 2</span>. The volume of a sphere has a
power-law relationship with the sphere’s radius as well: <span
class="math inline">$$y = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$</span> (so <span
class="math inline">$$b=\frac{4}{3}\pi$$</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 3</span>). <em>Scaling laws</em> are a
particular kind of power law that describe how deep learning models
scale. These laws relate a model’s loss with model properties (such as
the number of model parameters or the dataset size used to train the
model).</p>
<p><strong>Log-log plots can be used to visualize power laws.</strong>
Log-log plots can help make these mathematical relationships easier to
understand and identify. Consider the power law <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>b</em><em>x</em><sup><em>a</em></sup></span>
again. Taking the logarithm of both sides, the power law becomes <span
class="math inline">log (<em>y</em>) = <em>a</em>log (<em>x</em>) + log (<em>b</em>)</span>.
This is a linear equation (in the logarithmic space) where <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is the slope and <span
class="math inline">log (<em>b</em>)</span> is the y-intercept.
Therefore, a power-law relationship will appear as a straight line on a
log-log plot (such as Figure 2.22), with
the <em>slope</em> of the line corresponding to the <em>exponent</em> in
the power law.<p>

<p><strong>Power laws are remarkably ubiquitous.</strong> Power laws are
a robust mathematical framework that can describe, predict, and explain
a vast range of phenomena in both nature and society. Power laws are
pervasive in urban planning: log-log plots relating variables like city
population to metrics such as the percentage of cities with at least
that population often result in a straight line (see Fig 2.23). Similarly, animals’ metabolic
rates are proportional to an exponent of their body mass, showcasing a
clear power law. In social media, the distribution of user activity
often follows a power law, where a small fraction of users generate most
of the content (which means that the frequency of content generation
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> is proportional to the
number of active users <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>
multiplied by some constant and raised to some exponent: <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>b</em><em>x</em><sup><em>a</em></sup></span>).
Power laws govern many other things, such as the frequency of word usage
in a language, the distribution of wealth, the magnitude of earthquakes,
and more.</p>

<h2 id="scaling-laws-in-deep-learning">2.4.1 Scaling Laws in Deep
Learning</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>Power laws in the context of DL are called scaling laws <span
class="citation" data-cites="hestness2017deep kaplan2020scaling">[2],
[3]</span>.</strong> Scaling laws predict loss given model size and
dataset size in a power-law relationship. Model size is usually measured
in parameters, while dataset size is measured in tokens. As both
variables increase, the model’s loss tends to decrease. This decrease in
loss with scale often follows a power law: the loss drops substantially,
but not linearly, with increases in data and model size. For instance,
if we doubled the number of parameters, the loss does not just halve: it
might decrease to one-fourth or one-eighth, depending on the exponent in
the scaling law. This power-law behavior in AI systems allows
researchers to anticipate and strategize how to improve models by
investing more in increasing the data or the parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling laws in DL predict loss based on model size and
dataset size.</strong> In deep learning, power-law relationships exist
between the model’s performance and other variables. These scaling laws
can forecast the performance of a model given different values for its
parameters, dataset, and amount of computational resources. For
instance, we can estimate a model’s loss if we were to double its
parameter count or halve the training dataset size. Scaling laws show
that it is possible to accurately predict the loss of an ML system using
just two primary variables:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>: The size of the
model, measured in the number of <em>parameters</em>. Parameters are the
weights in a model that are adjusted during training. The number of
parameters in a model is a rough measure of its <em>capacity</em>, or
how much it can learn from a dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span>: The size of the
<em>dataset</em> the model is trained on, measured in tokens, pixels, or
other fundamental units. The modality of these tokens depends on the
model’s task. For example, tokens are subunits of language in natural
language processing and images in computer vision. Some models are
trained on datasets consisting of tokens of multiple
modalities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Improving model performance is typically bottlenecked by one of these
variables.</p>
<p><strong>The computational resources used to train a model are vital
for scaling.</strong> This factor, called <em>compute</em>, is most
often measured by the number of calculations performed over a certain
time. The key metric for compute is FLOP/s, the number of floating-point
operations the computer performs per second. Practically, increasing
compute means training with more processors, more powerful processors,
or for a longer time. Models are often allocated a set budget for
computation: scaling laws can determine the ideal model and dataset size
given that budget.</p>
<p><strong>Computing power underlies both model size and dataset
size.</strong> More computing power enables larger models with more
parameters and facilitates the collection and processing of more tokens
of training data. Essentially, greater computational resources
facilitate the development of more sophisticated AI models trained on
expanded datasets. Therefore, scaling is contingent on increasing
computation.</p>
<h3 id="the-chinchilla-scaling-law-an-influential-example">The
Chinchilla Scaling Law: an Influential Example</h3>
<p><strong>The Chinchilla scaling law emphasizes data over model size
<span class="citation"
data-cites="hoffmann2022training">[4]</span>.</strong> One significant
research finding that shows the importance of scaling laws was the
successful training of the LLM “Chinchilla.” A small model with only 70
billion parameters, Chinchilla outperformed much larger models because
it was trained on far more tokens than pre-existing models. This led to
the <em>Chinchilla scaling law</em>, which provides a scaling law that
depends on parameter count and data. This law demonstrated that larger
models require much more data than was standard.</p>
<figure id="fig:chinchilla">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamHodgkins/AISES/main/images/chinchilla.png" class="tb-img-full" style="width: 60%"/>
<p class="tb-caption">Chinchilla’s loss is much lower (indicated by its lighter color) than other models of

data-cites="chinchilla-image">[5]</span></p>
<!--<figcaption>Lighter colors indicate less loss - <span class="citation"-->
<!--data-cites="chinchilla-image">[5]</span></figcaption>-->
</figure>
<p><strong>The Chinchilla scaling law equation encapsulates these
relationships.</strong> The Chinchilla scaling law is estimated to be
<span class="math display">$$\label{eq:chinchilla}
    L(N,D) = 406.4N^{-0.34} + 410.7D^{-0.28} +
\underbrace{1.69}_{\text{Irreducible Error}}$$</span> In the equation above, <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> represents parameter count, <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> represents dataset size, and <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> stands for loss. This equation
describes a power-law relationship. Understanding this law can help us
understand the interplay between these factors, and knowing these values
helps developers make optimal decisions about investments in increasing
model and dataset size.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling laws for DL hold across many modalities and orders of
magnitude.</strong> An <em>order of magnitude</em> is a factor of 10x—if
something increases by an order of magnitude, it increases by 10 times.
In deep learning, evidence suggests that scaling laws hold across many
orders of magnitude of parameter count and dataset size. This implies
that the same scaling relationships are still valid for both a small
model trained on hundreds of tokens or a massive model trained on
trillions of tokens. Scaling laws have continued to hold even as model
size increases dramatically.<p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p><strong>Scaling laws are not universal for ML models.</strong> Not
all models follow scaling laws. These relationships are stronger for
some types of models than others. Generative models such as large
language models tend to follow regular scaling laws—as model size and
training data increase in scale, performance improves smoothly and
predictably in a relationship described by a power-law equation. But for
discriminative models such as image classifiers, clear scaling laws
currently do not emerge. Performance may plateau even as dataset size or
model size increase.</p>
<p><strong>Better learning algorithms can boost model performance across
the board.</strong> An improved algorithm increases the constant term in
the scaling law, allowing models to perform better with a given number
of tokens or parameters. However, crafting better learning algorithms is
quite difficult. Therefore, improving DL models generally focuses on
increasing the core variables for scaling: tokens and parameters.</p>
<p><strong>The bitter lesson: scaling beats intricate, expert-designed
systems.</strong> Hard-coding AI systems to follow pre-defined processes
using expert insights has proven slower and more failure-prone than
building large models that learn from large datasets. The following
observation is Richard Sutton’s "bitter lesson" <span class="citation"
data-cites="sutton2019bitter">[7]</span>:<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into
systems,</p></li>
<li><p>"This always helps in the short term [...], but in the long run
it plateaus and it even inhibits further progress,</p></li>
<li><p>Breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach
based on scaling computation by search and learning."</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This suggests that it is easier to create machines that can learn
than to have humans manually encode them with knowledge. For now, the
most effective way to do this seems to be scaling up deep learning
models such as LLMs. This lesson is “bitter” because it shows that
simpler scaling approaches tend to beat more elegant and complex
techniques designed by human researchers—demoralizing for researchers
who spent years developing those complex approaches. Rather than just
human ingenuity, scale and computational power are also key factors that
drive progress in AI.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>In AI, scaling laws describe how loss changes with model and
dataset size.</strong> We observed that the performance of a DL model
scales according to the number of parameters and tokens—both shaped by
the amount of compute used. Evidence from generative models like LLMs
indicates a smooth reduction in loss with increases in model size and
training data, adhering to a clear scaling law. Scaling laws are
especially important for understanding how changes in variables like the
amount of data used can have substantial impacts on the model’s
performance.</p>
