<!-- AI Governance -->

<h1 id="introduction">8.1 Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Safe artificial intelligence requires careful
governance.</strong> The development and deployment of advanced AI
systems involves many organizations and individuals with distinct goals
and incentives. These organizations and people can interact in
complicated ways, creating a complex sociotechnical system that we need
to govern effectively.<p>
There are a wide variety of issues that governance is required to manage
across different stages of AI development (from data collection through
various stages of training to deployment) and involving various actors
such as AI developers, businesses and consumers using AI systems, and
national governments, among others. Thoughtful governance provides the
constraints, incentives and institutions to steer AI progress in a
direction that benefits humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Governance refers to the rules and processes that coordinate
behavior.</strong> Governance is not just what governments do. Instead,
it can be defined more broadly as the process through which some
activity is organized, coordinated, steered, and managed. It includes
the norms, policies, and institutions that influence stakeholders’
actions to achieve socially desirable outcomes. In healthcare, for
instance, governance aimed at ensuring doctors avoid harming patients
for profit includes norms around patient care, professional ethical
standards, and licensing organizations. AI regulators should aim to
encourage safety and responsibility among developers and users to ensure
we reap AI’s benefits while managing the risks.</p>
<p><strong>Governance takes many forms across sectors and
levels.</strong> Governance institutions include governmental bodies
that create laws, companies that shape internal rules, and collaborative
initiatives involving both public and private groups. For example,
legislatures pass regulations, corporations adopt ethical guidelines,
and public-private forums establish AI safety best practices. Governance
operates at multiple levels as well, such as organizational policies,
national laws, and global agreements. Effective AI governance likely
requires a combination of approaches across sectors and levels.</p>
<p><strong>Overview.</strong> We begin by examining the ecosystem in
which governance takes place, including the relevant actors, such as
companies, governments, and individuals, and the tools available to
govern them. Then, we explore different scenarios around the speed of
growth in AI systems’ capabilities and their implications. Next, we
consider issues around the distribution of power of AI systems, access
to AI, as well as costs, benefits and risks.<p>
We then survey policy tools for AI governance at the corporate, national
and international levels. For corporations, we explore legal structures,
ownership models, and assurance mechanisms that impact AI safety. At the
national level, we consider regulations, liability frameworks,
resilience, and competitiveness. For international governance, we
examine tools ranging from standards and certification for civilian AIs
to non-proliferation agreements, verification schemes, and monopolies
for military systems. By highlighting levers across multiple levels,
this chapter provides an introduction to a range of governance
approaches aimed at ensuring AI is developed safely.</p>
<h2 id="the-landscape">8.1.1 The Landscape</h2>
<p>To govern AI, we must understand the system in which AIs are being
developed and deployed. Two crucial aspects for governance are the list
of actors and the tools available to govern them.</p>
<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>
<p>AI governance involves many diverse groups across sectors that have
different goals and can do different things to accomplish them. Key
actors include companies, nonprofits, governments, and individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Companies develop and deploy AIs, typically for
profit.</strong> Major firms such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind shape
the AI landscape through huge investments in research and development,
creating powerful models that advance AI capabilities. Startups may
explore new applications of AI and are often funded by venture
capitalists. The section looks at policies, incentives, and structures
such as ownership models of organizations that impact the development
and deployment of AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>Nonprofits play a variety of roles aimed at improving
society.</strong> Some nonprofits aim to develop safe AI systems. For
example, OpenAI was initially founded as a nonprofit. Others engage in
advocacy and coordination by bringing together companies, governments,
and research labs to collaborate on development and regulation. Academic
labs such as MILA research AI capabilities, and some researchers there
aim to make AI more beneficial. Some nonprofits perform a mix of these
functions.</p>
<p><strong>National governments make laws, regulations, and
standards.</strong> National governments can directly shape AI
development and use within their jurisdictions through legislative and
regulatory powers such as market rules, public investment, and
government procurement policies; for instance, governments might require
licensing to develop large models, provide funding for AI research and
development, and require government contractors meet certain safety
standards. Governments of states such as the United States and United
Kingdom directly oversee technological development and commercialization
locally through their democratic processes and administrative
procedures. We will explore the role of governments in the National Governance section.</p>
<p><strong>International organizations facilitate cooperation between
countries.</strong> Organizations such as the United Nations, European
Union, and OECD have influence across borders by setting policies,
principles, and ethics standards that countries often implement locally.
International governance institutions allow countries to coordinate on
issues such as human rights or non-proliferation of dangerous
technologies across national borders. While international governance
mechanisms such as treaties are less enforceable than domestic tools
such as laws, they can exert soft power through financing, expertise,
norm-setting, and bringing countries together for dialogue and
consensus-building. We explore these tools in the section.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals use and are deeply impacted by AI
systems.</strong> AIs ultimately have profound impacts on individuals.
Externalities from AIs, such as invasions of privacy, concentration of
economic power, and catastrophic risks, are experienced by individuals,
as are many of the potential benefits such as rapid economic growth. As
consumers, individuals buy and use AI products and services, which means
they can apply social pressure to force development along specific
routes. As citizens, they can exert pressure through voting and other
forms of democratic representation. Their needs and perspectives should
be a central consideration.</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>The AI governance landscape includes the sets of tools or mechanisms
by which actors interact and influence one another. Key tools for AI
governance fall into four main categories: information dissemination,
financial incentives, standards and regulations, and rights.</p>
<p><strong>Information dissemination changes how stakeholders think and
act.</strong> Education and training transmit technical skills and shape
the mindsets of researchers, developers, and policymakers. Sharing data,
empirical analyses, policy recommendations, and envisioning positive
futures informs discussions by highlighting opportunities, risks, and
policy impacts. Facts are a prerequisite for the creation and
implementation of effective policy. Increasing access to information for
individuals and organizations can change their evaluations of what’s
best to do.</p>
<p><strong>Financial incentives influence behavior by changing payoffs
and motivations.</strong> Incentives such as funding sources, market
forces, potential taxes or fees, and regulatory actions shape the
priorities and cost-benefit calculations of companies, researchers, and
other stakeholders. Access to funding and well-regulated markets (such
as those with IP and competition protections) encourages technology
development and commercialization, while potential taxes or regulatory
penalties impose financial and reputational risks that promote caution
and consideration of governance goals. By shaping incentives,
governments can increase the degree to which private companies or other
actors’ opportunities and risks are aligned with those of society as a
whole.</p>
<p><strong>Standards and regulations set expectations and boundaries for
behavior.</strong> There is a spectrum of rules - from flexible
guidelines to rigid laws - that encompasses many different governance
tools. At one end, the flexible guidelines look like standard operating
procedures and industry norms, which codify preferred practices within
and across institutions. At the other end, governments use formal and
enforceable tools including regulations and legislation, which carry
penalties for violations and aim to both address specific risks and
shape industries broadly. Well-designed rules establish which actions
are allowed or prohibited for organizations and individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Rights grant freedoms, entitlements, and claims over
assets.</strong> Human rights and civil liberties, such as privacy, free
speech, and due process, shape relationships between individuals and
organizations by defining unacceptable behaviors. Property rights and
intellectual property regimes determine ownership and control over
assets such as data, algorithms, trained models, and compute. Outlining
rights clearly can establish strong governance regimes that allow
litigation against any infringements.<p>
The diverse actors in AI development and deployment along with the
varied governance tools at our disposal form an intricate ecosystem.
Companies, researchers, governments, and individuals influence progress
based on their capabilities and incentives. Financial incentives,
established rules, delineated rights, and information sharing steer
beliefs and behaviors. Next, we will consider an issue central to
defining the landscape in which governance will take place: at what rate
should we expect the capabilities of AI systems to progress?</p>
