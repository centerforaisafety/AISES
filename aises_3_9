<h1 id="conclusion">3.9 Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed several key themes: we do not know how
to instill our values robustly in individual AI systems, we are unable
to predict future AI systems, and we cannot reliably evaluate AI
systems. We now discuss each in turn.</p>
<p><strong>We do not know how to instill our values robustly in
individual AI systems.</strong> It is difficult to perfectly capture our
idealized goals in the proxies we use to train AIs. The problem begins
with the learning setup. In gathering data to form a training set and in
choosing quantitative proxies to optimize, we typically have to make
compromises that can introduce bias and perpetuate harms or leave room
for proxy gaming and adversarial exploits.<p>
In particular, our proxies may be too simple, or the systems we use to
supervise AIs may run into practical and physical limitations. As a
result, there is a gap between proxies and idealized goals that
optimizers can exploit or adversarially optimize against. If proxies end
up diverging considerably from our idealized goals, we may end up with
capable AI systems optimizing for goals contrary to human values.</p>
<p><strong>We are unable to predict future AI systems.</strong> Emergent
capabilities and behaviors mean that we cannot reliably predict the
properties of future AI systems or even current AI systems. AIs can
suddenly and dramatically improve on specific tasks without much
warning, which leaves us little time to react if those changes are
harmful.<p>
Even when we are able to robustly specify our idealized goals, processes
including mesa-optimization and intrinsification mean that trained AI
systems can end up with emergent goals that conflict with these
specifications. AI systems may end up operationally pursuing goals
different to the ones we gave them and thus change their behaviors
systematically over long time periods. This is further complicated by
emergent social dynamics that arise from interacting AI systems
(explored further in the chapter on Collective Action Problems).</p>
<p><strong>We cannot reliably evaluate AI systems.</strong> AI systems
may learn and be incentivized to deceive humans and other AIs, in which
case their behavior stops being a reliable signal for their future
behavior. In the limiting case, AI systems may cooperate until exceeding
some threshold of power or capabilities, after which they defect and
execute a treacherous turn. This might be less of a problem if we
understood how AI systems’ internals work, but we currently lack the
thorough knowledge we would need to break open these “black boxes” and
look inside.<p>
This chapter has touched on a number of research areas in machine
learning and other subjects which may be useful to address risks from
AI. These are summarised in the table below, which is not intended to be
an exhaustive list.<p>

unexpected rare events, or emergent phenomena. There are numerous relevant hazards
from AI and other sources that anomaly detection could possibly identify more reliably
or identify earlier, including proxy gaming, rogue or unethical AI systems, deception
from AI systems, Trojan models, and malicious use</li>
                <li>Anomaly detection can allow models to flag salient anomalies for human review or
execute a conservative fallback policy. A successful anomaly detector could serve as an
AI watchdog that could reliably detect and triage rogue AI threats. Anomaly detectors
could also be helpful for detecting other threats such as novel biological hazards

improving the tradeoff between ethical behavior and practical performance. If advanced
AIs are given objectives that are poorly specified, they could pursue undesirable
actions and behave unethically. If these advanced AIs are sufficiently powerful, these
misspecifications could lead the AIs to create a future that we would strongly dislike</li>
                <li>Ambitious research goals in this area include building models with relevant abilities such
as detecting situations where moral principles apply, assessing how to apply those moral
principles, evaluating the moral worth of candidate actions, selecting and carrying out
actions appropriate for the context, monitoring the success or failure of those actions,
and adjusting responses accordingly</li>

In conclusion, single-agent systems present significant and
hard-to-mitigate threats that could result in catastrophic risks—even
before the considerations of misuse, multi-agent systems, and arms race
dynamics that we discuss in subsequent chapters.<p>
